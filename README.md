Today's challenge is another exciting one!

Project Name: Intro Component with Sign-Up Form.

This project is a user-friendly sign-up form component designed to collect user information efficiently. Users can input their details and receive immediate feedback if any fields are incorrect. If the form is filled out correctly, a sweet alert pops up, making the user experience even cooler.‚ö°Ô∏è

Technologies Used:
#HTML

#CSS (including Flexbox and media queries)

#JavaScript

1. HTML Structure
The HTML file includes a form with inputs for first name, last name, email, and password. It uses semantic HTML elements like div, input, and button for structure and functionality.

2. CSS Styling
Font Import: I've Used Google Fonts to import the "Poppins" font for a clean and modern look.

Global Styles: Resets default padding and margin, sets box-sizing, and specifies the font-family for consistency across different browsers.

Flexbox: Utilized to center the container and align items efficiently.

Background and Styling: Sets the background color, dimensions, padding, border-radius, and box-shadow for a visually appealing design.

Responsive Design: Utilizes media queries to adjust the layout and visibility for different screen sizes.

3. JavaScript Functionality
Input Validation: Adds event listeners to validate the input fields for first name, last name, email, and password.

Error Handling: Displays error messages and icons if any fields are incorrect or empty.

Sweet Alert: If the form is filled out correctly, a sweet alert pops up, making the user experience even cooler.

Submit Functionality: Shows a success message upon form submission if all inputs are valid.
